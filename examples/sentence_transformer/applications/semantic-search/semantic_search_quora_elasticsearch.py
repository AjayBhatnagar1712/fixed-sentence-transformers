"""
This script contains an example how to perform semantic search with Elasticsearch.

As dataset, we use the Quora Duplicate Questions dataset, which contains about 500k questions:
https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs

Questions are indexed to Elasticsearch together with their respective sentence
embeddings.

The script shows results from BM25 as well as from semantic search with
cosine similarity.

You need Elasticsearch up and running locally:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/run-elasticsearch-locally.html

Further, you need the Python Elasticsearch Client installed:
https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/

This script was created for `elasticsearch` v8.0+.

As embeddings model, we use the SBERT model 'quora-distilbert-multilingual',
that it aligned for 100 languages. I.e., you can type in a question in various languages and it will
return the closest questions in the corpus (questions in the corpus are mainly in English).
